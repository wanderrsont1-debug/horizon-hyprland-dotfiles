```
sudo pacman -Syu usbmuxd
```

```
sudo systemctl start usbmuxd
```

pelrain recovery mode:

or do vol up , vol down, power button until screen turns black, then quickly vol down+ power for 3 seconds , then release power button but keep holding down vol down for 5 seconds and then release. shoudl be on a black screen. and connected to pc the whole time btw
```bash
paru -S --needed palera1n --noconfirm
```

```bash
palera1n -D
```
```bash
palera1n -h
```
or download the binary and make it exicutable 
```bash
sudo chmod u+x palera1n
```

```
sudo /mnt/zram1/future_restore/iphonee/palera1n-linux-x86_64 -D
```


gaster : (to boot untrusted images)
make sure it's exicutable first 
```bash
sudo chmod u+x gaster
```

```
sudo /mnt/zram1/future_restore/iphonee/gaster pwn
```

gaster " to find the usb handle
```
sudo /mnt/zram1/future_restore/iphonee/gaster reset
```

to set nonce
make sure it's exicutable first 
```bash
sudo chmod u+x futurerestore
```

this will need to be run several times cuz it fails on the first try sometimes. 
```
sudo ./futurerestore -t /mnt/zram1/future_restore/iphonee/4878275665063854_iPhone10,2_d21ap_16.6-20G75_27325c8258be46e69d9ee57fa9a8fbc28b873df434e5e702a8b27999551138ae.shsh2 --use-pwndfu --set-nonce --latest-sep --latest-baseband /mnt/zram1/future_restore/iphonee/iPhone_5.5_P3_16.6_20G75_Restore.ipsw
```

now, if it doesn't automatcially go into recovery mode, go into it manually by button combo. vol up vol down and power hold. and you should see the pc and cable logo on the iphone. 

restart usbmxd service and leve the terminal open
```
sudo systemctl stop usbmuxd && sudo usbmuxd -p -f
```

futurerestoring main 
, this also needs to be run a few times before it suceeds, sometimes the phone needs to be disconnected and quickly reconneced during the process, like at the place it gets stuck is where the phone should quickly be reconneced
```
sudo ./futurerestore -t /mnt/zram1/future_restore/iphonee/4878275665063854_iPhone10,2_d21ap_16.6-20G75_27325c8258be46e69d9ee57fa9a8fbc28b873df434e5e702a8b27999551138ae.shsh2 --latest-sep --latest-baseband /mnt/zram1/future_restore/iphonee/iPhone_5.5_P3_16.6_20G75_Restore.ipsw
