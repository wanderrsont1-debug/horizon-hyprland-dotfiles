# Fresh Arch Linux Installation Checklist

This checklist provides a structured overview of essential tasks to perform after a fresh Arch Linux installation. Follow these steps to configure your system, restore your environment, and set up your applications.

> [!NOTE] Sections with "*Script*" at the top indicate that section has been automated with a script at the following location.  
> ```bash
> cd ~/user_scripts/arch_setup_scripts/scripts/
> ```

> [!IMPORTANT]+
> Steps to be followed Sequentially. 
> there are going to be a few errorw displayed on the top of the screen by hyprland, ignore those, they will eventually go away as each step is followed to the T

### 1. Core System & Environment Setup

This phase focuses on critical system files, user environment, and restoring your base configuration.

- [ ] **Login with uwsm** 

```bash
exec uwsm start hyprland
```

- [ ] **Connect to the internet**: Depending on what you use, (ie tethering does not usually need to be setup) [[Network Manager]]

---

- [ ] *Optional but recommended* There are 2 commands that are long and complex, to prevent typos, it's recommended to copy paste them by SSH'ing into the PC from a phone or another pc, for referenced- not needed to refer to [[SSH]]

```bash
sudo systemctl start sshd && ip a
```

---
*Script*
**OPTIONAL**
- [ ] limit battery temperately (asus tuf f15) (might need to change `BAT1`to see what's available for your laptop for this command to work)

```bash
echo 60 | sudo tee /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_control_end_threshold
```

---

- [ ] **Restore Dotfiles:** Download the `git` bare repository and deploy the files on your PC [[Restore Backup On a Fresh Install]].

**OPTIONAL**
>[!error]+ Your mouse button will be reversed AFTER RESTORING THE DOTFILES, if you're using a physical mouse. 
>Trackpad not effected. You'll later have the option to set it back to normal configuration in the steps below, or you could do it right now in the following file
>```bash
>nvim ~/.config/hypr/source/input.conf
>```
> change`left_handed = true` to `left_handed = false`

---

**OPTIONAL**
- [ ] If you want to quickly find out how to do something using an existing keybind, hold down `ALT` + `6` for the rofi menu to list the keybind list

---

- [ ] **Link Restored Vault files to Obsidian** : open and link to existing vault. 
- When you open Obsidian for the first time, you'll be prompted with three options. Select "open Folder as Vault (Choose an existing folder of Markdown Files)" this directory should have been populated in ~/Documents/pensive/ after you restored the git files. 

- make sure to NOT create a new vault or sync. select the aforementioned option and navigate to the pensive directory to be selected as source for existing markdown files. 

- You can then copy paste commands from Obsidian on the same PC, no SSHing required

---

- [ ] **DNS configuration**
symbolic link so systemd resolved gets used instead of the isp. 

```bash
sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

[[Systemd Resolve Config]]

---
*Script*
- [ ] **Set up GNOME Keyring:** Configure GNOME Keyring with PAM for password management. [[Gnome Keyring PAM]]

---
*Script*
- [ ] **Enable UserSession Services**. 

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now pipewire.socket pipewire-pulse.socket wireplumber.service hypridle.service hyprpolkitagent.service fumon.service gnome-keyring-daemon.service gnome-keyring-daemon.socket hyprsunset
```

---
*Script*
- [ ] configure Reflector config. 
```bash
sudo nvim /etc/xdg/reflector/reflector.conf
```

replace the entire content of the file with this. 
```ini
--save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

# Select the transfer protocol (--protocol).
--protocol https

# Select the country (--country).
# Consult the list of available countries with "reflector --list-countries" and
# select the countries nearest to you or the ones that you trust. For example:
--country India

# Use only the  most recently synchronized mirrors (--latest).
--latest 6

# Sort the mirrors by synchronization time (--sort).
--sort rate 
```

**OPTIONAL**
- [ ] Syncing Pacman Mirrors for faster Download Speeds

if your downloads are currently slow, run this. (**Though Usually not needed**)
```bash
sudo reflector --protocol https --country India --latest 6 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

---
*Script*
- [ ] **pacman-keyring** You must run `pacman-key --init` before first using pacman; the local
keyring can then be populated with the keys of all official Arch Linux packagers with `pacman-key --populate archlinux`.

```bash
sudo pacman-key --init
```

```bash
sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
```


---
*Script*
**OPTIONAL**
- [ ] enabling better pacman visuals while downloading packages and faster downloads

```

and then enable the service 
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now network_meter
```

---
*Script*
- [ ] **Create a symlink** for the service file in user_scripts/battery/battery_notify.service, so the service works. , this is done because service files are looked for in .config/systemd/user/.

- option b: with waypaper :- just open waypaper from rofi or terminal and select the wallpapers directory and select any image, or open waypaper with the keybind `Alt + 4` and pick your wallpaper

- option c :or run this command to have matugen generate the colors and place them in required direcotries for the errors to go away 
this command picks an image at random and generates a color pallette for it. 
```bash
matugen image "$(find "$HOME/Pictures/wallpapers" -type f | shuf -n 1)"
```

or pick a specific image manually 
```bash
matugen image $HOME/Pictures/Wallpapers/image.jpg
```

*Script*
`Check carefully before changing the following qtct files, these might already be as they should becase they should have been restored from github but sometimes the lines change on a fresh install. And if this step needs to be carried out, only change the lines specified below and nothing else. leave everything as is.`

- [ ] **for qt5ct**  Theming with matugen
open this file

```bash
nvim ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf
```

replace these lines at the top of the file with this

```bash
[Appearance]
color_scheme_path=$HOME/.config/matugen/generated/qt5ct-colors.conf
custom_palette=true
standard_dialogs=default
style=Fusion
```

- [ ] **for qt6ct**  Theming with matugen
open this file

```bash
nvim ~/.config/qt6ct/qt6ct.conf
```

replace these lines at the top of the file with this

```bash
[Appearance]
color_scheme_path=$HOME/.config/matugen/generated/qt6ct-colors.conf
custom_palette=true
standard_dialogs=xdgdesktopportal
style=Fusion
```

if qt apps still aren't follwing the color pallete of matugen. *sometimes you might need to open `qt5ct` and `qt6ct` and mess around with its settings*

---
*Script*
- [ ] **Gtk3/Gtk4 root symlink**

```bash
# 1. Get your home directory reliably
USER_HOME=$(getent passwd "$USER" | cut -d: -f6)

# 2. Ensure root config directory exists
sudo mkdir -p /root/.config

# 3. Delete existing root GTK folders (Clean slate)
sudo rm -rf /root/.config/gtk-3.0 /root/.config/gtk-4.0

# 4. Create the Symlinks (User -> Root)
# -s: symbolic, -f: force, -T: no-target-directory (prevents nesting)
sudo ln -sfT "$USER_HOME/.config/gtk-3.0" /root/.config/gtk-3.0
sudo ln -sfT "$USER_HOME/.config/gtk-4.0" /root/.config/gtk-4.0
```

---
*Script*
` This step, again, is usually not needed to be done but check if its needed, by setting a wallpaper with waypaper and see if the theme has switched, open and close the terminal/thunar/or anyother app,  to see if it's switched colors, if not, then preceed with the following:` if themes did switch sucessfuly, this step is not required. 

- [ ] Might need to recreate the config file for waypaper because sometimes it's got issues when it's restored from git. so delete the entire file, open waypaper> change any setting> when a new config is auto created, edit it just the post_command line to include the command. 

```bash
rm ~/.config/waypaper/config.ini && waypaper
```

```bash
nvim ~/.config/waypaper/config.ini
```

```ini
post_command = matugen --mode dark image $wallpaper
```

## or
	(not recommended because this is not persistent and it doesnt change it for matugen colors)
- [ ] manually open nwg-loog and set the `color scheme` to either `prefer dark` or `prefer light` if it doesn't apply automatically when switching wallpaper and triggering the matugen command

---

**OPTIONAL**

- [ ] Obsidian themeing (matugen)
Obsidian doesn't usually respect matugen theming on its own so you need to manually do two things. 
first, make sure you've set the appropriate colro scheme for your current theme - dark/light from the waybar. 

then open obsidian's settings > Appearance > Scroll to the bottom to `CSS snippets`> Toggle on the `matugen-theme` option, and not the other one (if it exists). if you toggle on both, sometimes they will both be toggled off the next time you open Obsidian

---

### 2. Very Important to REMOVE the following configs if you have a PC other than Asus Tuf f15 2022 or a pc without a Dedicated GPU like NVIDIA or AMD

Fine-tune your Hyprland compositor and shell environment. These steps are often machine-specific.

> [!CAUTION]+
> The following steps involve hardware-specific settings. Adjust them carefully based on whether you are on Asus tuf 15 or another pc  and what GPU you are using.

## For non Asus tuf f15 laptops

**Clean Environment Variables:**

- [ ] Comment OUT any and all environment variable under the Nvidia section in the uwsm env file. 

```bash
nvim ~/.config/uwsm/env
```

> [!error]+ Comment OUT Everything Beyond This Line

>\#COMMENT OUT ANY SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE IF YOU DONT HAVE NVIDIA
>\#--------------------------------------------------------------

also comment out this line 

> [!error]+ put a hash before it. 
>```ini
>export LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=iHD
>```

---

- [ ] Comment OUT this variable If you only have integrated GPU i.e no NVIDIA

```bash
nvim ~/.config/uwsm/env-hyprland
```

```

 - [ ] This line is to run a script for configuring asus profiles for Asus specific hardware and for changing keyboard color along with fan control. 
 
 ```bash
 nvim .config/hypr/source/keybinds.conf
 ```


>[!error]+ Comment out Asus specific Script
>```ini
>binddl = , XF86Launch3, ASUS Control, exec, uwsm-app -- $terminal --class asusctl.sh -e sudo $scripts/asus/asusctl.sh
>```

- [ ] Comment OUT the custom key-binds for changing refresh rate that are specific to asus laptops with 144 hz with  `Alt+6` and `Alt+7`.

> [!error]+ Comment OUT these two lines
>```ini
> bindd = ALT, 7, Set Refresh rate to 48Hz Asus Tuf, exec, hyprctl keyword monitor eDP-1,1920x1080@48,0x0,1.6 && sleep 2 && hyprctl keyword misc:vrr 0
>bindd = ALT, 8, Set Refresh rate to 144Hz Asus Tuf, exec, hyprctl keyword monitor eDP-1,1920x1080@144,0x0,1.6 && sleep 2 && hyprctl keyword misc:vrr 1
>```

- [ ] IF you dont plan on using tts/stt, comment out these lines. 

> [!error]+ comment them out if you dont plan on using the tts/stt
> ```ini

> explination of the command
> By running this command, you are telling your system, "From now on, whenever you are asked to 'open' a directory, use the application defined in thunar.desktop." This change is saved specifically for your user in the ~/.config/mimeapps.list file.
> xdg-mime default: This is the command to set a default application.
>thunar.desktop: This is the standard desktop entry for the Thunar application. The system looks for this file in /usr/share/applications/ to get information about how to run Thunar.
>inode/directory: This is the official MIME type for a folder or directory.

*Script*
- [ ] On hybrid laptop setups (dGPU + iGPU), `swaync` (Sway Notification Center) can default to binding to the dGPU. This prevents the discrete card from suspending (D3cold state), leading to significantly higher power draw. To fix this, a systemd drop-in override is often used to force the iGPU. However, if you are strictly on a single GPU setup or need to disable this fix for debugging, you should disable the override file. 
Method: Safe Disable (Rename) Instead of `rm -rf`, we rename the file with a `.bak` extension. **Why this works:** `systemd` parses drop-in directories (`*.d`) strictly looking for files ending in `.conf`. Any other extension is ignored during the load process, effectively disabling the config while preserving the file for rollback. 

1. Rename the Configuration Move the active configuration file to a backup state. 
   
```bash
mv ~/.config/systemd/user/swaync.service.d/gpu-fix.conf ~/.config/systemd/user/swaync.service.d/gpu-fix.conf.bak
```


```bash
# Reload the systemd user manager configuration
systemctl --user daemon-reload

# Restart swaync to apply the new execution environment
systemctl --user restart swaync

#verify the status
systemctl --user status swaync
```

2. to roll back the change 

```bash
mv ~/.config/systemd/user/swaync.service.d/gpu-fix.conf.bak ~/.config/systemd/user/swaync.service.d/gpu-fix.conf
```

then reload systemd user dameon like above.
